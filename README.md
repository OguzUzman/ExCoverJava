# ExCoverJava
Written in Java, a multi-threaded implementation of ExCover algorithm(Yoshitaka Kameya).
It seems to work, but it is incomplete and needs further development.
You can test the algorithm using the following parameters to the ExCover:

-i="dataset folder name" -s="Score measure" -t="Number of Threads"

For Mushroom dataset:
-i=mushroom -s=f -t=1

For Splice_n dataset:
-i=splice_n -s=f -t=8

And so on...
